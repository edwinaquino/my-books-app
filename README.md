# React MyReads App

This is a fund and challenging project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project is built using React and uses  an API server to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

* Clone this project using Git: `git clone https://github.com/edwinaquino/my-reads.git`
* cd into my-reads folder: `cd my-reads`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* Open In Browser - Your app should now be running on port 3000. One your browser to: http://localhost:3000

## Requirements
* React V16.6.3
* React Router: 4.2.2
* React Scripts: 2.1.1

```

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, a backend server was provided by Udaticy for the API. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
